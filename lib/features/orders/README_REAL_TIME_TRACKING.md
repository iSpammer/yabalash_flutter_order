# Real-Time Order Tracking Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds real-time food delivery tracking to the Flutter app, matching the React Native functionality with driver location updates, route visualization, and status tracking.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Order Tracking Service (`order_tracking_service.dart`)
- Fetches real-time order tracking data from the API
- Parses driver location (lat, lng, heading) from `agent_location`
- Extracts driver info and ETA
- Supports task-based location tracking for pickup/delivery points

### 2. Real-Time Updates
- 5-second polling interval matching React Native
- Automatic driver position updates when location changes
- Map auto-centers on driver when first location is received
- Stops tracking when order is delivered

### 3. Map Visualization
- **Driver Marker**: Blue marker with rotation based on heading
- **Restaurant/Pickup Marker**: Orange marker from tasks[0] or vendor location
- **Delivery Marker**: Green marker from tasks[1] or order address
- **Route Polylines**: 
  - Uses Google Directions API for actual road routes
  - Falls back to dotted line if API fails
  - Route changes based on driver status (to restaurant vs to customer)

### 4. Driver Information Display
- Shows driver photo, name, and rating when available
- Displays current status (e.g., "Going to Restaurant")
- Shows ETA when provided by API
- One-tap calling functionality
- Only displays when driver is assigned (dispatcher_status >= 2)

### 5. Improved Map Behavior
- Shows map even without driver (restaurant + delivery markers)
- Better initial positioning using available data
- Loading indicator while markers are being created
- Proper zoom and bounds fitting for all markers

## API Integration

The implementation uses the existing order-detail API endpoint with proper handling of:
- `agent_location`: Driver's current position
- `dispatcher_status_option_id`: Current delivery status (1-6)
- `tasks`: Array of pickup/delivery locations
- `dispatch_traking_url`: External tracking URL (if using LaLaMove)

## Usage

The tracking is automatically integrated into the existing order details screen. When viewing an active order:

1. The map displays immediately with restaurant and delivery markers
2. When a driver is assigned, their location appears and updates every 5 seconds
3. The route polyline shows the driver's path (to restaurant or to customer)
4. Driver info section appears with contact options

## Status Codes
- 1: Order Accepted
- 2: Driver Assigned
- 3: Driver Going to Restaurant  
- 4: Driver at Restaurant
- 5: Order Picked Up (driver going to customer)
- 6: Order Delivered

## Dependencies Added
- `flutter_polyline_points`: For route decoding
- `socket_io_client`: For future real-time socket updates
- `flutter_local_notifications`: For local notifications
- `location`: Alternative location services

## Next Steps

### Firebase Push Notifications
To enable push notifications for order updates:
1. Configure Firebase in the app
2. Implement the Firebase service (template provided)
3. Handle order update notifications
4. Update UI when notifications are received

### Socket.IO Real-Time Updates
For true real-time driver tracking without polling:
1. Implement the Socket service (template provided)
2. Connect to the WebSocket server
3. Subscribe to driver location updates
4. Replace polling with socket events

### Additional Enhancements
- Smooth driver marker animation between updates
- Custom driver vehicle icons
- Offline support with cached data
- Background tracking capability
- Sound/vibration alerts for status changes

## Testing
1. Place an order and wait for driver assignment
2. Verify map shows restaurant and delivery locations
3. Confirm driver marker appears when assigned
4. Check that route updates based on driver status
5. Test calling functionality
6. Verify tracking stops on delivery
