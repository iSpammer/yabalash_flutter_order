# Flutter App Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hero Widget Conflict
**Problem**: Multiple Hero widgets were sharing the same tag, causing navigation errors
**Solution**: 
- Updated Hero tag in `section_widget_factory.dart` from `'dashboard-product-${product.id}'` to `'dashboard-product-${product.id}-${sectionType}'`
- Updated Hero tag in `restaurant_card_v2.dart` from `'restaurant-${restaurant.id}'` to `'restaurant-${restaurant.id}-card'`

### 2. Category API Endpoint Issue
**Problem**: When clicking on "Restaurants" category, the app was trying to call `/category/28/products` which returned 404
**Solution**: 
- Modified `category_service.dart` to handle failed product endpoints gracefully
- Updated `category_provider.dart` to handle categories that redirect to vendors
- Note: The category API returns category details with an empty `listData` field for restaurant categories

### 3. Restaurant Detail Screen Issues
**Problem**: Restaurant name, banner, and other details weren't being displayed properly
**Solution**: 
- Fixed `RestaurantModel.fromJson()` to handle nested vendor data structure
- The API response wraps vendor data in a `vendor` object, so the parsing now checks for this wrapper
- Updated all field extractions to use `vendorData` instead of `json` directly
- Added proper fallbacks for fields like `phone_no` (vs `phone_number`), `order_min_amount` (vs `minimum_order_amount`), etc.

### 4. Data Parsing Improvements
- Fixed image URL extraction to handle both Map and String formats
- Added support for vendor-specific fields like `delivery`, `takeaway` (vs generic `is_delivery_available`, `is_pickup_available`)
- Improved delivery time parsing to handle various field names
- Fixed minimum order amount parsing to check multiple possible field names

## Testing
Created test file `test_fixes.dart` that verifies:
- RestaurantModel correctly parses vendor data with wrapper
- RestaurantModel correctly parses vendor data without wrapper
- All fields are properly extracted and mapped

## Remaining Issues to Address

### 1. Category Type Handling
The "Restaurants" category (type_id: 1, redirect_to: Product) should ideally show a list of restaurants/vendors, not products. This might require:
- Creating a separate route for vendor categories
- Implementing a vendor list screen
- Updating navigation logic to check category type and redirect appropriately

### 2. Product Parsing in Restaurant Detail
The restaurant detail screen still needs fixes for loading and displaying menu items/products properly.

### 3. API Consistency
The backend API has some inconsistencies:
- Category endpoint returns empty product list for restaurant categories
- Different field names for similar data (e.g., `phone_no` vs `phone_number`)
- Category types that redirect to "Product" but should show vendors

## Files Modified
1. `/lib/features/dashboard/widgets/section_widget_factory.dart` - Fixed Hero widget tag
2. `/lib/features/restaurants/widgets/restaurant_card_v2.dart` - Fixed Hero widget tag
3. `/lib/features/categories/providers/category_provider.dart` - Added vendor category handling
4. `/lib/features/categories/services/category_service.dart` - Added error handling for product endpoint
5. `/lib/features/restaurants/models/restaurant_model.dart` - Fixed vendor data parsing

## Recommendations
1. Implement proper vendor list screen for restaurant categories
2. Add better error handling and user feedback when API endpoints fail
3. Consider implementing offline caching for better user experience
4. Standardize API response formats on the backend for consistency
