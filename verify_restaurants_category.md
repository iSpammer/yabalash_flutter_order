# Restaurants Category Implementation Verification

## API Analysis

Based on the API testing, I discovered that categories in the Yabalash API can return either **products** or **vendors** based on the category's `type_id`:

- **type_id = 1** (redirect_to: "Product") → Returns products
- **type_id = 3** (redirect_to: "Vendor") → Returns vendors/restaurants

The "Restaurants" category (ID: 28) has `type_id = 1`, which means it returns products (restaurant menu items), not restaurant vendors.

## Implementation Updates

### 1. **Category Response Model** (`category_detail_model.dart`)
- Updated to check `type_id` and `redirect_to` fields to determine content type
- Properly separates vendors and products based on API response structure

### 2. **Category Service** (`category_service.dart`)
- Changed endpoint from `/category/{id}` to `/v2/category/{id}` to match React Native
- Added proper headers including:
  - `systemuser` (device ID)
  - `latitude` and `longitude` from query params
  - `currency`, `language`, and other required headers

### 3. **Category Screen** (`category_screen.dart`)
- Enhanced to handle three scenarios:
  1. **Only Vendors**: Displays full-screen vendor grid
  2. **Only Products**: Displays product list
  3. **Both Vendors & Products**: Shows both in separate sections

### 4. **API Service** (`api_service.dart`)
- Added device ID generation and caching
- Automatically includes `systemuser` header in all requests
- Adds location headers when provided in query parameters

## Current Status

The Flutter implementation now:
- ✅ Uses the correct v2 API endpoint
- ✅ Sends all required headers matching React Native
- ✅ Properly identifies vendor vs product categories
- ✅ Displays both vendors and products appropriately
- ✅ Handles mixed content gracefully

## Note on Restaurants Category

The "Restaurants" category (ID: 28) in the current API configuration returns **products** (menu items), not restaurant vendors. This is because its `type_id = 1`. If you want to display actual restaurants/vendors, you would need to:

1. Use a category with `type_id = 3`
2. Or have the backend change the category configuration
3. Or use a different API endpoint specifically for fetching restaurants

The implementation is now ready to handle both scenarios seamlessly!
