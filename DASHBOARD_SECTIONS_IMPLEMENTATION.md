# Dashboard Sections Implementation Summary

## Overview
The dashboard has been updated to properly handle and display all sections returned by the homepage API (v2/homepage endpoint).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Section Model Updates
- Updated `DashboardSection.fromJson()` to properly handle translations
- The model now uses translated titles when available (e.g., "YaBalash Bags" instead of "New Products")
- Improved `shouldDisplay` logic to handle different section types appropriately

### 2. Section Widget Factory Updates
- Added special handling for "YaBalash Bags" and "Surprise Bags" sections based on translated titles
- These sections now use the standard product card layout with special badges
- Updated badge and color functions to handle these special section types

### 3. Available Sections (from API response)

The following sections are returned by the API with data:

1. **Navigation Categories** (`nav_categories`)
   - Restaurants (13 products)
   - Groceries (1 product)
   - Bakeries (8 products)
   - Coffee shops (9 products)

2. **YaBalash Bags** (`new_products` with translation)
   - 6 featured new products
   - Purple-themed styling
   - Special "YABALASH" badge

3. **Surprise Bags** (`featured_products` with translation)
   - 6 featured products with discounts
   - Orange-themed styling
   - Special "SURPRISE" badge

4. **Vendors** (`vendors`)
   - 8 restaurants/vendors
   - Displayed as restaurant cards

5. **On Sale** (`on_sale`)
   - 6 products on sale
   - Red "SALE" badge

6. **Recently Viewed** (`recently_viewed`)
   - 6 recently viewed products

7. **Selected Products** (`selected_products`)
   - 6 curated products

## Empty Sections (no data)
The following sections are defined but have no data:
- Trending Vendors (appears twice)
- Best Sellers
- Dynamic HTML
- Recent Orders
- Cities
- Long Term Service
- Spotlight Deals
- Single Category Products
- Most Popular Products
- Banner
- Ordered Products

## Testing Instructions

1. Run the app and navigate to the dashboard
2. You should see the following sections in order:
   - Navigation Categories grid
   - YaBalash Bags (with "YaBalash Bags" title)
   - Surprise Bags (with "Surprise Bags" title)
   - Vendors list
   - On Sale products
   - Recently Viewed products
   - Selected Products

3. Each product section should display:
   - Appropriate section title
   - "See All" button
   - Horizontal scrolling list of product cards
   - Special badges (YABALASH, SURPRISE, SALE, etc.)
   - Add to cart functionality

## Known Issues Fixed

1. Sections were being displayed with incorrect titles - now using translations
2. Special sections (YaBalash/Surprise Bags) were not being styled differently - now have custom badges
3. Product cards now properly handle add to cart with variant/addon selection

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement dedicated screens for "See All" functionality
2. Add loading skeletons for sections while data loads
3. Implement pull-to-refresh to reload sections
4. Add analytics tracking for section interactions
