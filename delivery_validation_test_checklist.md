# Delivery Validation Test Checklist

## Overview
This document outlines all the delivery validations implemented in the Flutter app to match the React Native behavior.

## Implemented Validations

### 1. Address-based Delivery Validation ✅
- **Issue**: Flutter wasn't passing `address_id` to cart API
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated `CartService.getCartDetail()` to accept and pass `addressId` parameter
  - Modified `CartProvider` to use `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider` with `AddressProvider` dependency
  - Cart API now receives address ID: `/cart/list?type=delivery&address_id={id}`
- **Result**: Backend validates deliverability based on selected address

### 2. Primary Address Synchronization ✅
- **Issue**: Flutter wasn't calling `setPrimaryAddress` API like React Native
- **Fix**:
  - Added `setAddressAsPrimary()` method in `AddressProvider`
  - Updated address selection to call `/primary/address/{id}` API
  - Added 500ms delay for backend processing
- **Result**: Backend session properly tracks primary address for validation

### 3. Vendor Closed Status ✅
- **Locations**:
  - Restaurant cards show "CLOSED" badge when `isVendorClosed == true`
  - Cart screen displays `VendorClosedWarning` widget
  - Checkout button shows "Vendor Not Available" or "Schedule Order" based on vendor settings
- **Behavior**:
  - If vendor is closed and `closedStoreOrderScheduled == 1`: User can schedule order
  - If vendor is closed and scheduling not allowed: Checkout is blocked

### 4. Delivery Validation Messages ✅
- **Error Message**: "The specific items are not deliverable to this address. Please remove the items or change the address."
- **Displayed**: 
  - In `DeliverableSection` widget in cart
  - As snackbar when trying to checkout with undeliverable items
- **Checkout Button**: Changes to "Remove Undeliverable Items" when validation fails

### 5. Checkout Flow Validation ✅
The checkout button (`_buildCheckoutButton`) validates in this order:
1. User login status → "Login to Continue"
2. Delivery address (if delivery mode) → "Add Delivery Address"
3. Deliverability check → "Remove Undeliverable Items"
4. Vendor availability → "Vendor Not Available" or "Schedule Order"
5. Payment method → "Select Payment Method"
6. All checks pass → "Place Order"

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Delivery Address Validation
1. Add items from a restaurant to cart
2. Select a delivery address outside the restaurant's delivery zone
3. Verify:
   - Cart shows warning: "The specific items are not deliverable..."
   - Checkout button shows "Remove Undeliverable Items"
   - Clicking checkout shows error snackbar

### Test 2: Address Change Updates Cart
1. Add items to cart with a valid delivery address
2. Change to an invalid delivery address
3. Verify cart updates immediately without manual refresh

### Test 3: Vendor Closed Status
1. Add items from a closed vendor
2. Verify:
   - Restaurant card shows "CLOSED" badge
   - Cart shows vendor closed warning
   - Checkout behavior depends on `closedStoreOrderScheduled` setting

### Test 4: Schedule Order for Closed Vendor
1. Add items from vendor with `closedStoreOrderScheduled == 1`
2. Verify:
   - Cart shows option to schedule order
   - Checkout button shows "Schedule Order" if not scheduled
   - Can proceed after scheduling

## Key Files Modified
1. `/lib/features/cart/services/cart_service.dart` - Added address_id parameter
2. `/lib/features/cart/providers/cart_provider.dart` - Added AddressProvider dependency
3. `/lib/features/profile/providers/address_provider.dart` - Added setAddressAsPrimary method
4. `/lib/features/profile/screens/address_selection_screen.dart` - Calls setPrimaryAddress API
5. `/lib/main.dart` - Updated provider setup for dependency injection
6. `/lib/features/cart/screens/cart_screen.dart` - Enhanced validation logic
7. `/lib/features/cart/widgets/deliverable_section.dart` - Shows delivery warnings
8. `/lib/features/cart/widgets/vendor_closed_warning.dart` - Shows vendor status

## React Native Parity
The Flutter implementation now matches React Native by:
1. Passing address_id to cart API for backend validation
2. Setting primary address via API when selecting addresses
3. Showing exact same error messages
4. Blocking checkout with appropriate validation messages
5. Supporting scheduled orders for closed vendors when allowed
