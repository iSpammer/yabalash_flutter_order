# Loading Dialog Final Fix

## Issue
The CartLoadingDialog was not closing properly after the "Clear Cart & Add" action in the vendor conflict dialog.

## Root Cause
The issue was due to timing problems where:
1. The cart reload operation was completing asynchronously
2. The Navigator was trying to pop the dialog before all operations were complete
3. Multiple async operations were running in parallel causing race conditions

## Solution

### 1. Updated CartLoadingDialog.hide() Method
Added a delay before attempting to close the dialog:
```dart
static void hide(BuildContext context) {
  // Add a small delay to ensure all operations are complete
  Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 100), () {
    // Check if Navigator can pop before attempting
    if (context.mounted && Navigator.of(context).canPop()) {
      Navigator.of(context).pop();
    }
  });
}
```

### 2. Added Delays in Add to Cart Flow
Added strategic delays to ensure proper sequencing:
```dart
// After cart reload
if (success) {
  await cartProvider.loadCart();
}

// Add delay to ensure cart is fully loaded
await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 300));

// Hide loading dialog
if (context.mounted) {
  CartLoadingDialog.hide(context);
}

// Add delay before showing snackbar
await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 200));

// Show success/error message
```

### 3. Updated All Add to Cart Flows
Applied the same fix to:
- Regular add to cart (no addons)
- Add to cart with addon selection
- Clear cart & add (vendor conflict) - both with and without addons

## Result
The loading dialog now properly closes after all operations complete, ensuring:
1. Cart is fully loaded before hiding the dialog
2. No race conditions between async operations
3. Smooth user experience with proper visual feedback

## Testing
Test all scenarios:
1. Add item from same vendor (should work normally)
2. Add item from different vendor (should show conflict dialog)
3. Choose "Clear Cart & Add" (dialog should close properly)
4. Test with products that have addons
5. Test rapid clicking to ensure no stuck dialogs
