# Category Vendor Fix

## Issue
When clicking on vendor categories like "Restaurants" (ID: 28), the app was showing "no products found" because the category API endpoint returns vendors/restaurants instead of products.

## Solution
Implemented automatic detection and handling of vendor categories vs product categories.

### Changes Made:

1. **Created VendorGrid Widget** (`lib/features/categories/widgets/vendor_grid.dart`)
   - New widget to display vendors in a list format
   - Uses RestaurantCardV2 for consistent vendor display
   - Supports pagination and loading states

2. **Updated CategoryProductsResponse Model** (`lib/features/categories/models/category_detail_model.dart`)
   - Added `vendors` field to store vendor data
   - Added `isVendorCategory` flag to identify vendor categories
   - Automatic detection based on response structure (checks for vendor-specific fields)

3. **Enhanced CategoryProvider** (`lib/features/categories/providers/category_provider.dart`)
   - Added vendor storage and state management
   - Updated `loadProducts` to handle both products and vendors
   - Smart detection of category type based on API response
   - Updated `totalProducts` getter to work with both types

4. **Updated CategoryScreen** (`lib/features/categories/screens/category_screen.dart`)
   - Conditional rendering based on category type
   - Shows VendorGrid for vendor categories
   - Shows EnhancedProductCard for product categories
   - Updated loading states and error messages
   - Updated results count text ("X vendors found" vs "X products found")

### How It Works:

1. When a category is loaded, the API response is analyzed
2. If the response contains vendor-specific fields (vendor_name, delivery_charge, etc.), it's marked as a vendor category
3. The UI automatically switches between showing vendors or products
4. All existing filters and sorting continue to work for both types

### Testing:
- Click on "Restaurants" category - should now show list of restaurants/vendors
- Click on product categories (e.g., "Bakeries") - should show products as before
- Filters and sorting should work for both types
- Pagination should work correctly

### Benefits:
- No manual configuration needed
- Automatic detection based on API response
- Seamless user experience
- Maintains all existing functionality
