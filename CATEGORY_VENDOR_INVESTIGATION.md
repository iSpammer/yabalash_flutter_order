# Category Vendor Investigation

## Current Situation

When clicking on the "Restaurants" category (ID: 28), the API returns an empty list in the `listData.data` array. This appears to be a backend configuration issue rather than a frontend problem.

## API Response Analysis

From the API response for `/api/v1/category/28`:
```json
{
  "category": {
    "id": 28,
    "slug": "restaurants",
    "type_id": 1,
    "can_add_products": 0,
    "type": {"id": 1, "redirect_to": "Product"},
    "translation": [{"name": "Restaurants"}]
  },
  "listData": {
    "data": [],  // Empty array
    "total": 0   // No items
  }
}
```

## Key Observations

1. **Category exists**: The category metadata is properly configured
2. **Empty data**: The `listData.data` array is empty with `total: 0`
3. **Category type**: Has `type_id: 1` and `redirect_to: "Product"` suggesting it might be configured as a product category
4. **Can't add products**: `can_add_products: 0` might indicate it's meant for vendors

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed
1. Created vendor detection logic based on API response structure
2. Built VendorGrid widget to display vendors when detected
3. Updated CategoryScreen to handle both products and vendors
4. Added proper empty state messages

### ⚠️ Current Issue
The backend API is returning an empty list for the Restaurants category. This needs to be resolved on the backend side.

## Possible Solutions

1. **Backend Configuration**: The category needs to have vendors assigned to it
2. **Different Endpoint**: There might be a specific endpoint for vendor categories that we haven't discovered
3. **Location Required**: The API might require location parameters to return nearby restaurants

## Temporary User Experience

When users click on "Restaurants" category, they now see:
- "No vendors found"
- "No restaurants available in this category. Please check the main page for available restaurants."

This provides better guidance to users while the backend issue is resolved.

## Next Steps

1. Check with backend team about category configuration
2. Verify if vendors are properly assigned to category 28
3. Investigate if there's a different endpoint for vendor categories
4. Consider using the homepage vendor list as a workaround
