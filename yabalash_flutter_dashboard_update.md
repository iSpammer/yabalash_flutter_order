# YaBalash Flutter Dashboard - Dynamic Sections Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the dynamic dashboard system to match the React Native app features, making the Flutter app fully dynamic and backend-configurable.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Section System
- **V2 API Integration**: Updated DashboardService to use `/api/v1/v2/homepage` endpoint
- **Dynamic Section Models**: Created DashboardSection model supporting all section types
- **Section Factory Pattern**: Implemented SectionWidgetFactory for rendering different section types
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained fallback to legacy dashboard if dynamic sections are unavailable

### 2. Enhanced Navigation
- **Shell Routes**: Implemented ShellRoute with AppShell for persistent navigation
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Added CustomBottomNavigationBar with cart badge showing item count
- **Delivery/Pickup Toggle**: Integrated DeliveryPickupToggle with cart clearing confirmation
- **Search Integration**: Added functional search bar navigating to dedicated SearchScreen

### 3. Section Types Supported
All dynamic section types from the backend are now supported:
- `banner` - Banner carousel display
- `nav_categories` - Category grid navigation
- `vendors` - Restaurant listings
- `trending_vendors` - Featured restaurant carousels
- `new_products` - New product horizontal scrolls
- `featured_products` - Featured product displays
- `best_sellers` - Best selling items
- `on_sale` - Promotional product sections
- `brands` - Brand showcases
- `spotlight_deals` - Special offers
- `most_popular_products` - Popular items
- `recently_viewed` - User's recent views
- And many more...

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Delivery Mode Switching**: Toggle between delivery and pickup with cart protection
- **Cart State Management**: Smart cart clearing when switching delivery modes or vendors
- **Dynamic Layouts**: All sections render based on backend configuration and ordering
- **Visual Enhancements**: Beautiful UI with gradient badges, overlays, and modern design

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created

#### Core Components
- `lib/core/widgets/app_shell.dart` - Main app shell with bottom navigation
- `lib/core/widgets/bottom_navigation_bar.dart` - Custom bottom navigation with cart badge
- `lib/core/routes/app_router.dart` - Updated router with shell routes and search

#### Dashboard System
- `lib/features/dashboard/models/dashboard_section.dart` - Dynamic section model
- `lib/features/dashboard/widgets/section_widget_factory.dart` - Section rendering factory
- `lib/features/dashboard/widgets/delivery_pickup_toggle.dart` - Mode switching component
- `lib/features/dashboard/services/dashboard_service.dart` - V2 API integration
- `lib/features/dashboard/providers/dashboard_provider.dart` - Enhanced state management
- `lib/features/dashboard/screens/dashboard_screen.dart` - Dynamic dashboard UI

#### Search Integration
- `lib/features/search/providers/search_provider.dart` - Search state management
- `lib/features/search/screens/search_screen.dart` - Comprehensive search interface

#### Main App
- `lib/main.dart` - Added SearchProvider to app providers

### API Integration

#### V2 Homepage Endpoint
```dart
Future<ApiResponse<List<DashboardSection>>> getHomepageSections({
  double? latitude,
  double? longitude,
  String type = 'delivery',
}) async {
  // Calls /api/v1/v2/homepage with location and delivery type
  // Returns dynamic sections in homePageLabels array
}
```

#### Dynamic Section Processing
- Backend sections are parsed from `homePageLabels` array
- Each section contains: `id`, `slug`, `title`, `data`, `translations`
- Sections are rendered in backend-specified order
- All section types are supported through factory pattern

### State Management

#### Dashboard Provider Enhancements
- **Dynamic Sections**: `List<DashboardSection> get sections`
- **Delivery Mode**: `DeliveryMode get deliveryMode` with switching logic
- **Location Awareness**: GPS integration for location-based content
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and fallbacks

#### Cart Integration
- Cart clearing confirmation when switching delivery modes
- Vendor-specific cart protection
- Item count badge in bottom navigation

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Full Parity**: Flutter app now matches React Native app functionality
2. **Backend Control**: All sections configurable and reorderable from backend
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new section types without code changes
4. **User Experience**: Smooth navigation with bottom bar and search
5. **Performance**: Efficient loading and rendering of dynamic content
6. **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with factory patterns

## Usage

The dashboard now automatically:
1. Loads dynamic sections from the V2 API
2. Renders sections in backend-specified order
3. Supports all section types (YaBalash Bags, Surprise Bags, etc.)
4. Handles delivery/pickup mode switching
5. Provides search functionality across all content
6. Maintains cart state with appropriate protections

Users can now experience the full YaBalash app functionality with dynamic, backend-controlled content that matches the original React Native implementation.
