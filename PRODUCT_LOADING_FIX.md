# Product Loading Fix - Preventing Flash of Previous Content

## Problem
When loading a new product from the dashboard, the previously opened product would briefly flash on screen before the new product loaded.

## Root Cause
The `ProductDetailProvider` was not clearing the previous product data when loading a new product. This caused the UI to display the old product information while the new data was being fetched.

## Solution

### 1. Clear Previous Data on Load
Modified `loadProductDetails` in `ProductDetailProvider` to immediately clear all previous product data:

```dart
Future<void> loadProductDetails(int productId, {double? latitude, double? longitude}) async {
  // Clear previous product data immediately to prevent showing old content
  _product = null;
  _reviews = [];
  _offers = [];
  _relatedProducts = [];
  _selectedImageIndex = 0;
  _quantity = 1;
  _selectedVariantId = null;
  _selectedAddonIds = [];
  _canUserReview = false;
  _orderIdForReview = null;
  _orderVendorProductIdForReview = null;
  _reviewEligibilityReason = null;
  
  _isLoading = true;
  _errorMessage = null;
  notifyListeners();
  
  // ... rest of loading logic
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Loading State
Created a beautiful loading screen with shimmer effects instead of just a spinner:

```dart
Widget _buildLoadingState() {
  return Scaffold(
    // ... app bar ...
    body: SingleChildScrollView(
      child: Column(
        children: [
          // Image placeholder with shimmer
          Shimmer.fromColors(
            baseColor: Colors.grey[300]!,
            highlightColor: Colors.grey[100]!,
            child: Container(
              height: 300.h,
              width: double.infinity,
              color: Colors.white,
            ),
          ),
          // Title, price, and description placeholders with shimmer
          // ... shimmer placeholders ...
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Benefits

1. **No Flash of Old Content**: Previous product data is cleared immediately
2. **Professional Loading State**: Shimmer effect provides visual feedback
3. **Better UX**: Users see a proper loading skeleton instead of old data
4. **Smooth Transitions**: Loading state matches the layout of actual content

## Visual Improvements

The loading state now includes:
- Shimmer effect on all placeholders
- Proper layout that matches the loaded content
- Loading indicator with text feedback
- Skeleton placeholders for image, title, price, and description

## Result

When navigating between products, users now see:
1. Immediate transition to loading state
2. Beautiful shimmer placeholders
3. Smooth fade-in when new product loads
4. No flash of previous product content
