- User interaction
- State changes

#### Test Structure
```
test/features/payment/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ payment_method_model_test.dart
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ place_order_model_test.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ payment_service_test.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ payment_method_card_test.dart
â””â”€â”€ providers/
    â””â”€â”€ payment_provider_test.dart (requires mock generation)
```

### 5. Fixed Issues
- **Address ID Type**: Updated AddressModel to include numeric ID for API compatibility
- **Product TypeId**: Added typeId field to ProductModel for stock checking logic

## ðŸ“± App Status
The app is now running successfully with the complete payment implementation. All build errors have been resolved.

## ðŸ§ª Test Results
```
âœ… 23 tests passed
- 5 PaymentMethodModel tests
- 7 PlaceOrderModel tests  
- 4 PaymentService tests
- 7 PaymentMethodCard widget tests
```

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. **Generate Mocks**: Run `flutter pub run build_runner build` to enable provider tests
2. **Integration Testing**: Test complete flow on device/emulator
3. **API Testing**: Test with real payment gateway responses
4. **Error Scenarios**: Test network failures and edge cases

## ðŸ”§ Usage
To place an order:
1. Add items to cart
2. Select delivery address
3. Tap "Place Order" 
4. Select payment method
5. Add delivery instructions (optional)
6. For card payments, fill card details
7. Tap "Pay & Place Order" or "Place Order" (for COD)
8. Complete payment in WebView (if off-site)
9. View order success screen

The implementation follows the same flow and patterns as the React Native app while leveraging Flutter's capabilities for better performance and user experience.
