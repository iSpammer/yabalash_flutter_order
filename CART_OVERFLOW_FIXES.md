# Cart Screen Overflow Fixes

## Overview
Fixed various text overflow issues in the cart screen and related widgets to ensure proper display of long text content.

## Changes Made

### 1. Cart Item Card (`cart_item_card.dart`)
- **Product Name**: Already had `maxLines: 2` and `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis`
- **Variant Options**: Added `maxLines: 1` and `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` to handle long variant names
- **Addon Information**: Added `maxLines: 2` and `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` to handle long addon titles and options
- **Added proper padding** to addon items for better spacing

### 2. Cart Screen (`cart_screen.dart`)
- **Vendor Header**: Added `maxLines: 1` and `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` to vendor name to prevent overflow on long restaurant names

### 3. Promo Code Section (`promo_code_section.dart`)
- **Applied Promo Code**: Added `maxLines: 1` and `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` to handle long promo code names

### 4. Other Widgets Reviewed
The following widgets were reviewed and found to already have proper overflow handling:
- **Animated Address Section**: Uses `Expanded` widget and has `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` for address text
- **Vendor Closed Warning**: Uses `Expanded` widget for text content
- **Deliverable Section**: Uses `Expanded` widget for warning messages
- **Cart Summary Widget**: Uses fixed layout with proper spacing
- **Tip Selection Widget**: Uses `Wrap` widget which handles overflow automatically
- **Schedule Order Widget**: Uses `Expanded` widget for date/time display

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with long product names (50+ characters)
2. Test with multiple variant options with long names
3. Test with multiple addons with long titles
4. Test with long restaurant/vendor names
5. Test with long promo code names
6. Test on different screen sizes (small phones to tablets)

## Additional Improvements Possible

1. Consider adding tooltips for truncated text to show full content on tap/hover
2. Consider responsive font sizing for better adaptation to screen sizes
3. Consider adding horizontal scrolling for very long addon lists

## Summary
All text overflow issues in the cart screen have been addressed. The cart items now properly handle long text content by truncating with ellipsis, preventing layout breaks and ensuring a clean user interface.
